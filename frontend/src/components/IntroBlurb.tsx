      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada, where my passion for
        technology began at a young age. Whether it was tinkering with tech or
        spending hours gaming with friends, I was always drawn to exploring
        complex systems. That same drive led me into software development, where
        I get to use my problem-solving skills and creativity to tackle
        technical challenges. Professionally, I work across the stack, but I
        also love drawing up new ideas for the games I mod in my spare time.
        When building projects I always try to spend my time on works that
        others can use and enjoy.

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My approach to building is simple: I create
        things I’d want to use myself. That mindset has given me the chance to
        give back to communities that have given me so much over the years. If
        you’re interested, be sure to check out some of those projects in the
        dedicated section of this portfolio. Currently, I work heavily with
        TypeScript, Java, and Python, bringing ideas to life through code and
        turning concepts into real, usable products. If you’ve got a cool idea
        or just want to nerd out over tech, feel free to reach out!

        TLDR; I played games, learned to code, and now I'm a tech guy.
